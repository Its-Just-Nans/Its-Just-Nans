High Output Management (1995) - Andrew Grove

Interesting thinking:

- Family monthly meeting
- If we try to focus on everything, we focus on nothing.
- Dual reportingm means that an employee has multiple positions in the organization, and so, mutliple bosses. Similar to have "two life".
- Two ways to improve performance: training and motivation
