`photo-copier` is a simple project to copy images from a folder to another. And also to sort them through a GUI.

Its main use is to sort images from a camera or phone to your computer.

`photo-copier` was made for windows - path handling is very poorly done.

This program can be packaged with `pyinstaller` to create a standalone executable.
