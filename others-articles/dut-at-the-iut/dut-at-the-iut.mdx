The DUT (Diplôme Universitaire de Technologie) is a two-year diploma awarded by an IUT (Institut Universitaire de Technologie).

My IUT was the IUT Nice Côte d'Azur (south of France). And the building was at Sophia-Antipolis.

The DUT R&T is a diploma that trains us as a higher-level technician and network administrator.
This diploma provides us with a lot of technical skills (IPv4 networks, telephony) but also practical skills (project implementation).

We also learn various programming languages (C, Python, PHP, Java...).

A movie created for my DUT (in Network and computer science - on 2021-04-01) for the competition "Je filme ma formation" (I film my school education).

## 2021-06-10 - Student app

`student-app` is a quiz app developed by three students for students.

This project was created for the "Android" course at DUT R&T. The topic was open-ended, with only one requirement: use a database provided by the instructor.

The challenge was that the database could only store key-value pairs (related to a user id), so we had to figure out a way to save the questions and answers in a format that would allow easy retrieval.
