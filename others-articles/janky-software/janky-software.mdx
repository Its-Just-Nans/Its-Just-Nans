## Software

### `make`

Make is problematic as a build tool for modern software projects for several reasons:
- Whitespace sensitivity (tabs vs spaces)
- `make` does not describe what should happen, only what commands to run. This means a Makefile can do literally anything, with no structure, validation, or safety.
- Encourages shell-script abuse instead of modeling builds

### `git apply`

- fails without error

## File format

### Yaml

- Ambiguous parsing (Norway problem)

### ini

- No standard (every parser differs)
- No nesting

### PDF

- Not meant for data extraction
- No semantic structure


## Bad bad bad

- "It's working on my side"
